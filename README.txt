When using this template, I urge you to look at he code carefully especially when using the image slider.  It took me a while to get it right.  I read many tutorials and step-by-step's on how to get a handle on the animations controls and how they relate to the overall workflow of the slider.

Most of the code in this template is pretty straighforward from then on.  The main stylesheet of the template manipulates the various shared sections and tags throughout the template.  The individual pages have their own homebrewed stylesheets in order to demonstrate the different things that can be achieved thru the power and robust nature of pure CSS3.  

This template can be easily transformed into CMS template if you know how to pull that off.  I originally started this template with the hopes of one day turn it into a Drupal theme.  But As I kept working on it I realized that it can also be used independent of a CMS. 

In the parts of the template where Javascipt makes an appearance (some things are better off left to javascript like email verifications and the likes) I comment in great detail why Javascript is beind used instead of CSS.  Also, licenses for the use of said Javascript if not homebrewed is also included in this template.  This also goes for any other language (PHP, Python, Perl, etc) that appears throughout the template.  The applications written in these other languages are also template-independent.  I did my due diligence in learning to write the programs and applications myself so that I may offer them as "free software".  Whenever there is a problem with any of the code or applications, I will comment extensively on my troubleshooting and findings.
